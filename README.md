# The LaTeX Template Modernization Project

## What is this about?
We attempt to *modernize the technical implementation* of existing LaTeX 
templates, such as those used for writing reports, scientific papers, 
and theses. This primarily relates to the  *packages* and *toolchain* 
used -- *aesthetics and typography* may be modernized as well, but are 
not front-ranking issue.


## Why does it exist?
There is a growing gap between what LaTeX and its constantly evolving 
toolchain can do, and what existing but seldom-updated templates 
actually use, suggest as best practices, and allow. Documents based on 
such templates do still compile, but there are good reasons (from both 
technical and usability points of view) why up-to-date versions of every 
component should be used. See the links at the end of this document for 
a few pointers.

It's a waste of everyone's time to continue using and wrangling with 
outdated templates. It's just as big of a waste if someone fixes 
a template *for themselves only*, for it forces others to recreate 
similar fixes independently.

Thus, we put updated templates here so that anyone can benefit.
We hope you find them useful. We hope you contribute back, too!
